# Sentry Prevent CLI

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/getsentry/prevent-cli/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/getsentry/prevent-cli)

The Sentry Prevent CLI is responsible for uploading code coverage and test results to Sentry. It can be used directly or indirectly through our [Sentry Prevent GitHub Action](https://github.com/getsentry/prevent-action).

This Repo and README are still a work in progress.
