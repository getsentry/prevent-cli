# Sentry Prevent CLI

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/getsentry/prevent-cli/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/getsentry/prevent-cli)

The Sentry Prevent CLI is responsible for uploading code coverage and test results to Sentry. It can be used directly or indirectly through our [Sentry Prevent GitHub Action](https://github.com/getsentry/prevent-action).

> [!NOTE]  
> The Codecov CLI is still around! We have moved the Codecov CLI's codebase into the `codecov-cli` sub-project in this repository because the Sentry Prevent CLI uses it as a backend and we wanted to keep the projects together in the `getsentry` organization. The Codecov CLI is still being maintained, improved, and published - just from this repository. See the sub-project's [README](/codecov-cli/README.md) for Codecov CLI specific information, the rest of this document will be about the Prevent CLI.

# Installing

As of today, you are not able to install the Sentry Prevent CLI. We are planning to release it on the PyPI and for direct download in the near future.

If you're determined, you can build the CLI yourself from source by running `uv build` in the `prevent-cli` directory.
